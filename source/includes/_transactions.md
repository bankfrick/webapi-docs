# Transactions

Get the list of payment orders based on the search parameters. The user also requires corresponding read privileges for the customer account.
If a combination of filter parameters are applied, only orders that match all of the conditions are returned.

Here is a brief overview of the transaction state lifecycle:

![Transaction state lifecycle](/images/documentation/bank-frick-transaction-lifecycle.jpg "Transaction state lifecycle")

* **PREPARED**: After a transaction is created via the API, it enters the `PREPARED` state, indicating it is ready for further processing.
* **IN_PROGRESS**: When the transaction is signed, it moves to the `IN_PROGRESS` state, meaning it is being processed.
* **EXECUTED**: If the transaction is successfully processed, it moves to the `EXECUTED` state.
* **BOOKED**: After the transaction is fully processed and finalized by the core banking system, it reaches the `BOOKED` state. `BOOKED` is the final state and it cannot change afterwards.
* **REJECTED**: A transaction can be marked as `REJECTED` if it is deleted by the user or rejected by the bank.
* **EXPIRED**: If the transaction is not signed within seven days, it automatically expires and enters the `EXPIRED` state.
* **DELETED**: If a planned future transaction is deleted by the user before execution, it moves to the `DELETED` state.

Create new payment orders similar to the create payment order dialogs within the online banking frontend. The required fields and field validation for each payment order depends on the order type. The frontend dialog and pain001 mapping rules apply for field validation. New payment orders can only be created for accounts with proper write privileges for the customers account. Created payment orders will be added to the system in the PREPARED state and can be approved using the ‚ÄúsignTransaction‚Äù methods. The application must assign an idempotent customId to allow the system to identify duplicate requests. The server will then assign a unique orderId which is used to identify the transaction later for approval or deletion.
